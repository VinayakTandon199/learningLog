Snake Game using Tkinter
This repository contains a simple Snake game built using the Tkinter library in Python. The game allows you to control the snake using the arrow keys, with the goal of collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

Features
Basic Snake Movement: Control the snake with the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Food Generation: Randomly generated food that increases the snake's length when consumed.
Score Tracking: The current score is displayed, which increases with each piece of food collected.
Game Over: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body, with a "Game Over" message displayed.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (which comes pre-installed with Python)
